# Getting Started with Misfits!

Welcome to Misfits! - the AI-driven life simulation game where emergent narratives unfold through the chaos of AI-powered personalities.

## What is Misfits!?

Misfits! is a life simulation game where:
- **No Scripts**: All character dialogue and behavior is generated by AI
- **Just Chaos**: Unpredictable events and emergent storylines
- **AI Personalities**: Each character has unique AI-driven behavior
- **Player Influence**: Guide the chaos without direct control

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/misfits-game.git
cd misfits-game
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/setup.py
```

### 2. First Run
```bash
python main.py
```

The game will start with:
- 4 diverse AI characters (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave)
- Comedy & Chaos simulation mode
- Mock AI provider (no external LLM needed)

### 3. Basic Interaction
- **Watch**: Observe characters as they interact autonomously
- **Chaos Button**: Press it to trigger random events
- **Intervention**: Whisper suggestions to characters

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Basic Setup (Recommended for First Time)
Uses mock AI provider - no external dependencies needed.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Option 2: With Local LLM (More Realistic AI)
Requires Ollama or LM Studio for better AI responses.

#### Ollama Setup
```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
ollama pull llama2:7b-chat
# Game will automatically detect and use it
python main.py
```

#### LM Studio Setup
1. Install LM Studio
2. Load a chat model (Llama 2 7B recommended)
3. Start local server on port 1234
4. Run the game

### Option 3: Full Installation (All Features)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install sentence-transformers torch  # For better semantic memory
python main.py
```

- Wait for it to be ready (shows "üé≤ CHAOS")
- Click/press it to trigger a random event
- Watch how characters react

### 4. Whisper to a Character
```bash
# In a future UI version, you'd have buttons for this
# For now, this happens automatically in the simulation
```

### 5. Check the Timeline
- Review what events have occurred
- See how character relationships have changed
- Notice the emergent storylines developing

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration (`data/game_config.yaml`)
```yaml
simulation:
  default_mode: "comedy_chaos"    # Start mode
  tick_interval: 5.0              # Seconds between updates
  max_characters: 10              # Character limit

llm:
  primary:
    provider: "ollama"            # or "mock" for testing
    model: "llama2:7b-chat"       # AI model to use
```

### Character Creation
Characters are automatically created with interesting personality combinations:
- Conflicting traits (romantic + nihilist)
- Hidden desires (confident person secretly insecure)
- Complex behavioral weights
- Unique dialogue styles

## Tips for New Players

### 1. Start Small
- Begin with Comedy & Chaos mode
- Use mock AI provider initially
- Focus on understanding one or two characters

### 2. Let It Run
- The magic happens over time
- Don't intervene too much at first
- Watch for emergent patterns and stories

### 3. Experiment
- Try different simulation modes
- Use the chaos button strategically
- Test character responses to interventions

### 4. Read the Logs
- Console output shows character thoughts
- Helps understand AI decision-making
- Reveals hidden story elements

## Next Steps

### Explore Advanced Features
- Set up real LLM providers for richer AI
- Try different simulation modes
- Experiment with custom personalities

### Contribute to Development
- Report bugs and suggestions
- Create custom personality templates
- Share interesting emergent stories

### Join the Community
- Share screenshots and stories
- Discuss AI behavior patterns
- Collaborate on mods and extensions

## Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Start
- Check Python version (3.10+ required)
- Run `python scripts/setup.py` first
- Verify all dependencies installed

### Characters Seem Repetitive
- Install a real LLM provider (Ollama/LM Studio)
- Try different simulation modes
- Adjust personality parameters

### Performance Issues
- Reduce tick_interval in config
- Lower max_characters setting
- Use lightweight LLM models
